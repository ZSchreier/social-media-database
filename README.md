# In **Module 18 Challenge:** Social Media backend

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a MongoDB backend for a social media site that could create, update, and delete Users and their Thoughts, with other smaller features such as adding/removing from a friend's list and storing reactions to a Thought. The routing and storae were handled by the express and mongoose node packages respectively. The greatest hurdle encountered with this undertaking was ensuring a proper set-up for the models, followed by making sure the import routes were correct for the other various files. The syntax for some functions were difficult and required some consultation of documents and forums found through search engines.
